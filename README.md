# interpreta

Interpreta is an experimentation platform that allows for mechanistic interpretability of large language models. 

Features include:
- Autoscaling notebook environment backed by a k8s cluster, which allows for memory intensive experiments from the comfort of a notebook.
- Notebooks will have all of your favourite ML/interpretability packages preinstalled through a custom dockerfile. This dockerfile can be altered to add or remove any packages. For now, I'll include Neel Nanda's favourite tools/packages. He built an open source version of gar√ßon that is great. 


## Stack 

- k8s cluster infrastructure: terraform.
- k8s cluster resources: kubectl/manifests. 
- k8s cluster packages: managed through helm. 
- Containers: docker.
